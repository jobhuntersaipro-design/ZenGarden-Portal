# Current Feature

Phase 06 — Dashboard (`docs/specs/06-dashboard.md`)

## Status

Complete. Merged to `main` 2026-09-05.

## Goals

- `src/lib/analytics/` — pure, unit-tested: `buckets`, `range`, `sales`,
  `fulfillment`, `share`, `churn`, `price-drift`. No Prisma in the folder
- `loadDashboard(range, agg)` runs the queries and calls the library
- Page order, exactly: three KPI tiles → one trend card → the two status bars →
  the collapsed "More analytics" disclosure → the in-range table
- `RangeControls` with preset chips primary, custom dates behind a toggle,
  aggregation secondary; state in `?from=&to=&agg=&trend=&more=`
- KPI tiles render their real value on first paint; the count-up animates from
  there and never replays on a range, trend or disclosure change
- `SalesLineChart`, `StackedStageChart`, `StatusBar` ×2, the two donuts

## Notes

- Read `docs/specs/00-master.md` before this phase file.
- The `dataviz` skill is loaded. The six-stage categorical palette re-validated
  clean: worst adjacent CVD ΔE 9.1 (protan), normal-vision floor ΔE 16.3. The
  contrast WARN on three stage fills is discharged by the legend, the direct
  labels and the 2px surface gaps — not dismissed.
- No dual-axis chart anywhere; categorical hues in fixed stage order, never
  cycled; colours read from CSS variables, never hex literals in components.
- The range-independent work-queue strip was cut on 2026-09-05 and must not
  come back: it repeated counts the status bar already carries.
- **Inherited blockers:** `R2_ACCOUNT_ID` and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` are still
  placeholders. The dashboard reads confirmed POs, so the seeded 400 exercise
  nearly all of it; only the extraction-failure figure depends on real
  extractions.

## History

- 2026-04-12: Respond.io API crawler built and first full crawl completed (1,582 contacts) — **retired 2026-09-05**
- 2026-04-12: Started Playwright automation for "Conversation Opened By" field — **retired 2026-09-05**
- 2026-09-04: Respond.io crawler and `/dashboard` marked for retirement (Phase 01). Portal spec set written in `docs/specs/`.
- 2026-09-05: Design review applied to the canvas and to every spec. Upload left the sidebar; the dashboard leads with a work queue and folds its analytics away; a totals mismatch locks Confirm on the review screen; one status palette; sentence-case labels; truncation recovery; KPIs render their real value on first paint. Canvas sources now live in `docs/design/`.
- 2026-09-05: Renamed ZenGarden to Loving Hands across the specs, context files and all twelve artboards; seed addresses moved to `@lovinghandsportal.com` and the canvas bundle and design spec became `loving-hands-*`. Business, data model and product catalogue unchanged. Fixed two latent clipping bugs surfaced by the new name: every wordmark variant used `line-height: 1`, which cropped the descender of "Loving" under `background-clip: text` (the sidebar mark also moved up to the on-system `heading-md` 26px), and the Main/Buyer chart x-axis labels were clipped to their own flex cell instead of overflowing into the empty neighbouring ones.
- 2026-09-05: Phase 01 §1 — Respond.io crawler, `/dashboard`, `src/lib/dashboard` and the four `crawl*` scripts deleted. `recharts` kept for Phase 06.
- 2026-09-05: Phase 06 complete and merged — the pure analytics library (`buckets`, `range`, `sales`, `fulfillment`, `share`, `churn`, `price-drift`) with 70 tests, `loadDashboard` at 422 ms for Last year daily, and the page in its specified order: three KPI tiles, one trend card, the two status bars, the collapsed disclosure, the table last. KPI figures cross-checked against independent raw SQL — 400 orders, RM 8,161,352.29, 11 buyers. Three defects found and fixed: `buckets.startOf` never truncated the time for daily aggregation, so Last 30 days ending now drew 31 columns; the donut and line-chart palettes reached for `--color-primary`, which shadcn's `@theme inline` block rebinds to ink, so the validated hues were never the rendered ones (now unshadowed `--color-share-1..6`); and Recharts' default bar animation meant a screenshot caught an empty plot, the same failure the KPI count-up rule exists to prevent. **Known, not fixed:** `--ring` is set from `--color-primary` and is therefore ink rather than the purple the design system specifies — a Phase 01 issue affecting every focus ring in the app.
- 2026-09-05: Phase 05 complete and merged — the shared table machinery (`DataTable` taking `onSortChange`, `TablePagination`, `parsePagination`/`parseSort`, status and stage badges), the merged list over `PurchaseOrder` and `Extraction` as a parameter-bound `UNION ALL`, the filter row with live chip counts, and the detail page (breadcrumb, Lifecycle card, `StageStepper` with the breathing loop, document/data split, Activity, revisions, edit sheet). `advanceStage`/`revertStage` guard the update on the stage the caller last saw. Verified against the seeded data: advance, super-admin move back with a required note, and an edit appearing in Activity — all rolled back afterwards. **Criterion 4 is unverified** (R2 placeholder) and criterion 8 is covered by unit tests rather than two real tabs. The database caught three things the types could not: Postgres refuses an `ORDER BY` over a `UNION` that uses an expression rather than a result column name; "Confirmed by" ascending sorted the backlog to the bottom because ASC defaults to NULLS LAST, not NULLS FIRST as my comment claimed; and clearing the filters left the search text in the box. Two review findings from the first half were also fixed before shipping: `DataTable` hardwired its own URL writing, which would have stopped Phase 08's segmented control sharing sort state, and `StatusDot` took a `text-*` class where a background was needed. The edit sheet deliberately omits money and line items — editing totals after confirmation would bypass the Phase 04 totals gate and its audit entry.
- 2026-09-05: Phase 04 complete and merged — `PoExtractionSchema`, the extraction system prompt, `extractPurchaseOrder` over `messages.parse` with `zodOutputFormat`, the shared `runExtraction` runner wired into `/api/upload/complete` and `retryExtraction`, `/api/documents/[id]/url`, the review screen (react-pdf source column, draft form, buyer/product comboboxes, line-item editing with amount recompute, 800 ms debounced `saveDraft`), the totals gate, the duplicate check with revision numbering, and `confirmPurchaseOrder`. **Criterion 1 is unverified** (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is a placeholder) and the source column cannot load (`R2_ACCOUNT_ID` likewise); everything else was verified against the seeded Neon database, including a full confirm that wrote a PO, six line items and a System stage event before being rolled back. A review pass found four defects, all fixed: the upload queue ignored the extraction result so a document Claude could not read still showed "Uploaded" and was counted in "Review N files"; the upload footer never linked to `/review`, leaving the whole multi-file review journey unreachable; the deferred "Extracting" row state was missing; and the review form defaulted `poDate` from UTC, pre-filling yesterday between midnight and 08:00 KL. Fixing them also surfaced two more: Retry re-uploaded a file that had arrived intact rather than asking for another read, and the queue's status vocabulary lived in the hook, coupling anything that reasoned about a row to the server actions and Auth.js.
- 2026-09-05: Phase 03 complete and merged — presign / complete / delete route handlers, `deleteOrphans()`, the `useUploadQueue` state machine (three concurrent XHR uploads, live progress, `beforeunload` guard), Dropzone with drop/browse/paste, one progress-bar geometry, plain-language failure reasons, the ready-only footer count, and "Upload PO" wired on Dashboard, Purchase orders and Buyers. **Criteria 1, 3, 4 and 8's enabled state are unverified**: R2 still holds placeholder credentials, so no browser PUT can reach the bucket. Re-run them once `docs/specs/SETUP-CHECKLIST.md` §2 is done. Fixed three defects found while building: `presignPut` pinned `ContentLength` to a ceiling rather than the file's exact size (S3 signs it exactly, so every real upload but one would have been refused); the `Document.r2Key` unique constraint needed a unique `pending:` placeholder because the key contains the row's own id; and the queue pump read a ref during render and drove state from an effect.
- 2026-09-05: Phase 02 complete and merged — Auth.js v5 with Google (approval-gated) and Credentials, database-backed rate limiting, forgot/reset/change password, five email templates, `src/proxy.ts` route protection, real `auth-guards.ts`, and the sidebar reading the real session. `auth-auditor`: 0 Critical, 0 High; both Mediums and three of five Lows fixed, the two accepted ones reasoned in `docs/audit-results/AUTH_SECURITY_REVIEW.md`. Added the `/admin` stub that acceptance criterion 5 measures against but Phase 01 never shipped, a password reveal toggle on every password field (not yet on the canvas), and two `@theme` tokens: `--spacing-control-oauth` and `--container-auth-card`.
- 2026-09-05: Phase 01 complete and merged — shadcn re-skinned to the tokens, Prisma 7 + Neon schema and first migration, deterministic seed, R2 / Resend / Claude / money / date / stage libraries with unit tests, App Shell with sidebar and placeholder pages.
